A pocketmine plugin, for adding OreSpawners a.k.a OreGens to your server, that will create ores upon them when placed, and can be stacked for making them faster.
# Installation
Download the plugin from poggit release and/or poggit CI
Put the .phar file, in your plugins folder and restart the server
- You can configure most of the settings in `config.yml`
# Commands
| command | aliases | description | permission|
|---------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| `/orespawner [ore] [amount] [player]` | `os` | Gives ore spawner to a player | `orespawner.give` |
# Stacking system
- Right click on a OreSpawner with the same type of OreSpawner in your hand.
- Stacking OreSpawners will reduce the time taken in ore spawning, we recommend keeping the `max` stack limit low
- Upon breaking a stacked OreSpawner, u you will get the amount back
